# JCE Superbuild

## Purpose

The in-repository superbuild provides one entry point for downloading, building,
and installing compatible JANA2, EVIO, and JCE versions into a shared prefix.
The normal JCE build remains available for developers and managed installations
that provide their own dependencies.

## Main Flow

1. Configure `superbuild/` with an installation prefix.
2. Build the generated project.
3. The superbuild downloads and installs JANA2 `v2026.03.01`, then EVIO
   `v6.1.2`, and finally builds this JCE checkout against both installations.
4. Downstream experiments use the resulting prefix through
   `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.

## Expected Behavior

- All three projects install into the selected `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
- Git tags are pinned by default and can be overridden with
  `JCE_JANA_GIT_TAG` or `JCE_EVIO_GIT_TAG`.
- Existing dependency checkouts can be selected with `JANA_SOURCE_DIR` and
  `EVIO_SOURCE_DIR`. Supplying both prevents JANA2 and EVIO downloads.
- EVIO remains responsible for managing its own Disruptor dependency.
- JANA examples and tests, EVIO examples, and JCE tests are disabled by
  default to keep the user build focused on installable runtime components.
- Developers can set `JCE_SUPERBUILD_BUILD_TESTING=ON` to build JCE tests and
  add the outer `check` target.
- The ROOT-based `evio_processor` remains disabled by default. Set
  `JCE_SUPERBUILD_EVIO_PROCESSOR=ON` and make ROOT discoverable through the
  outer `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to include it.
- EVIO is patched only in the superbuild's working source tree so that its
  CMake build honors the shared installation prefix. For offline builds, EVIO
  is first copied into the superbuild workspace so the original checkout is
  not modified.

## Failure Behavior

- Configuration fails when Git is unavailable.
- Download or build failures stop the dependent projects; JCE is not built
  against a partial dependency installation.
- System dependencies required by EVIO, including Boost and LZ4, must already
  be discoverable by CMake.
- A supplied dependency source directory must contain a `CMakeLists.txt` and
  must be compatible with the superbuild's configure options. The EVIO source
  must also accept the included `v6.1.2` install-prefix patch.

## Key Components

- `superbuild/CMakeLists.txt`
- `superbuild/patches/evio-respect-install-prefix.patch`
- Root `CMakeLists.txt` for the normal JCE build

## Verification

Configure without building to validate the outer project:

```tcsh
cmake -S superbuild -B build-super
```

The default installation prefix is `` `pwd`/jce-stack `` when configuring from
the repository root. Pass `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/another/path` to override it.

Build the complete stack when network access and system dependencies are
available:

```tcsh
cmake --build build-super --parallel
```

Build and run JCE tests in a separate developer build:

```tcsh
cmake -S superbuild -B build-super-tests \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/jce-test-stack \
  -DJCE_SUPERBUILD_BUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build-super-tests --target check --parallel
```

To avoid downloading JANA2 and EVIO, prepare both source trees in advance:

```tcsh
cmake -S superbuild -B build-super \
  -DJANA_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/JANA2 \
  -DEVIO_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/evio
cmake --build build-super --parallel
```

ROOT is intentionally not downloaded or built by the superbuild. To build the
optional `evio_processor`, provide an existing ROOT installation:

```tcsh
cmake -S superbuild -B build-super \
  -DJCE_SUPERBUILD_EVIO_PROCESSOR=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/root
cmake --build build-super --parallel
```
